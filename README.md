# uSOMEIP -- micro SOMEIP

Those codes is mirrored from https://github.com/autoas/ssas-public, and this library is source open for SOMEIP study&research, but not free for any other commercial usage.

This is a light weight SOMEIP/SD software stack implemented according to AUTOSAR 4.4 specification. And this can be deployed on either resource constrained MCU or on rich os such as windows/linux/android/QNX, etc.

## An example to play with:

* NetApp: An app with SOMEIP/SD.
* NetAppT: An anti-test purpose app with SOMEIP/SD

```sh
# The NetApp is built with FreeRTOS+LWIP sockets
set USE_LWIP=YES
# the index of the Virtual Box Network Adaptor "Oracle"
# on my PC, it's zero, but on your PC, it's maybe not
# and please staticly configured its ipv4 address to 172.18.0.1
set PACKET_LIB_ADAPTER_NR=0
scons --app=NetApp --os=FreeRTOS --net=LWIP

# The NetAppT is built with host windows sockets
set USE_LWIP=
scons --app=NetAppT

# in 2 different pannel, launch below commands to start the apps
build\nt\GCC\NetApp\NetApp.exe
build\nt\GCC\NetAppT\NetAppT.exe
```

When you launch the NetApp, generally you will see below messages, please note that for the NetApp + FreeRTOS + LWIP, it's using the [windows PCAP](https://www.winpcap.org/) to simulate a virtual network adapter for the easy study/development process. And I find that the [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) network adapter is the most stable one that works perfect.  So you need to install the VirtualBox and then manually configure its ipv4 address to "172.18.0.1", as below picture shows:

After all the applications launched, press key "s" to put SOMEIP related server/client/event group online, running for several seconds, press key "s" again to put them  offline, you can see logs as below:

![someip net log](https://autoas.github.io/ssas-public/images/someip-netapp-netappt-runing-log.png)

And under the root directory of ssas-public, you could see net.log and wireshark.pcap.

* net.log: A text file with logs about SOMEIP/SD
* wireshark.pcap: a network pcap file has all the ethernet packets received or transmitted by lwip
